# coronascraper
CLI for querying coronavirus Italian cases.

This is a pet project: it is not considered "complete" or "the best version possible".
It is not regularly updated or supported in any way. You can reuse any part of the project freely.
Maybe I'll update in the future with more features and perfect the shell calls.

 **USAGE**

Download or clone the repo.
Check you have a version of Python (3.9 recommended) installed.
Run:
```
cd coronascraper
pip install requirements.txt
```

Finally run:

```
python3 coronascraper.py
```
